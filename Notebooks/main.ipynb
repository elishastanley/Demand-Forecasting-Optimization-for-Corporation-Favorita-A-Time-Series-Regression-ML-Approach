    "## **Business Understanding**\n",
    "\n",
    "Corporation Favorita, a large grocery retailer based in Ecuador, aims to optimize its inventory management to ensure the right quantity of products is always in stock across its various locations. Effective inventory management is critical for maintaining high levels of customer satisfaction and minimizing costs associated with overstocking or stockouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this goal, we will build machine learning models to forecast the demand for products at different Favorita stores. Accurate demand forecasting will allow Corporation Favorita to make informed decisions regarding stock levels, promotions, and supply chain logistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective:\n",
    "1. **Develop Predictive Models**: Create models to forecast daily unit sales for thousands of products across multiple stores.\n",
    "2. **Understand Influencing Factors**: Analyze the impact of various factors on sales, including promotions, holidays, oil prices, store characteristics, and external events such as earthquakes.\n",
    "3. **Optimize Inventory Management**: Use the models to inform inventory decisions, ensuring that the right products are available at the right stores at the right time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis:\n",
    "1. Null Hypothesis (H0): Promotions do not have a significant impact on sales.  \n",
    "   Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Promotions have a significant impact on sales.\n",
    "2. Null Hypothesis (H0): Oil prices do not significantly impact sales.  \n",
    "   Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Oil prices significantly impact sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Analytical Questions:\n",
    "1. **Data Completeness**: Is the training dataset complete with all required dates?\n",
    "2. **Sales Extremes**: Which dates have the lowest and highest sales for each year (excluding days when stores were closed)?\n",
    "3. **Monthly Sales Trends**: Compare sales across months and years to identify the highest sales month and year.\n",
    "4. **Earthquake Impact**: Did the earthquake in April 2016 impact sales?\n",
    "5. **Store Performance**: Are certain stores or groups of stores (cluster, city, state, type) selling more products?\n",
    "6. **Promotions, Oil Prices, and Holidays**: How are sales affected by promotions, oil prices, and holidays?\n",
    "7. **Date Features Analysis**: What insights can be derived from date-related features?\n",
    "8. **Promotion Impact**: Which product families and stores were most affected by promotions?\n",
    "9. **Error Metrics**: What is the difference between RMSLE, RMSE, and MSE? Why might MAE be greater than these metrics?\n",
    "10. **Wage Payment Influence**: Does the bi-monthly payment of public sector wages influence store sales?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Sources\n",
    "- **train.csv**: Time series data of store, product information, promotions, and sales.\n",
    "- **test.csv**: Features similar to the training data for the 15 days following the last date in the training data.\n",
    "- **transaction.csv**: Daily transactions per store.\n",
    "- **stores.csv**: Metadata about stores including location and type.\n",
    "- **oil.csv**: Daily oil prices.\n",
    "- **holidays_events.csv**: Information about holidays and events, including special designations like transferred, bridge, and work days.\n",
    "- **sample_submission.csv**: A sample submission file for formatting predictions.\n"

    "\n",
    "The MAE can be greater than RMSLE, RMSE, and MSE for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. **Penalization of Errors**:\n",
    "   - MSE and RMSE penalize larger errors more than smaller ones because of the squaring operation. This can lead to a lower overall average error when large errors are infrequent.\n",
    "   - RMSLE focuses on the logarithmic difference, which means it is less sensitive to large absolute errors but more sensitive to relative differences, particularly when the true values are small.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. **Error Aggregation**:\n",
    "   - MAE aggregates errors linearly. It does not give extra weight to larger errors.\n",
    "   - In contrast, RMSE and MSE give extra weight to larger errors due to the squaring of the errors, which can reduce the impact of smaller errors on the overall metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. **Error Scale**:\n",
    "   - RMSLE takes the logarithm of the predicted and actual values, which scales down the impact of larger values. Therefore, the logarithmic transformation tends to reduce the magnitude of the errors before squaring and averaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`MAE`** is often higher because it considers the absolute error without additional penalization.\n",
    "- **`MSE`** and **`RMSE`** can be lower when large errors are infrequent because they square the errors, reducing the impact of smaller errors.\n",
    "- **`RMSLE`** can be much lower if the absolute differences are not large relative to the true values because it works with the logarithmic scale. "
